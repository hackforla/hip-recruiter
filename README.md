# Hip Recruiter 

Hip Recruiter is a Hack for LA data investigation project oriented around [this Kaggle problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/overview).

### This is all assuming OSX

$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter notebook

Ideas from Kate:
bias language removal, shorter sentences, removing passive voice, plain language principles, pulling descriptions for same jobs in other major metros cities to identify differences/better scoring samples.

plain language replacement: https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/`
