The examination will consist of a qualifying written test, an advisory essay, and interview.  In the qualifying multiple-choice written test, candidates may be examined for knowledge of: safety principles, practices, and regulations as they relate to the inspection of municipal recreational facilities for observable hazards, and providing a safe environment in all municipal recreational facilities per Cal/OSHA safety regulations; Department of Recreation and Parks policies and the Los Angeles Municipal Code relating to recreation facilities; Department of Recreation and Parks budget procedures; Department's Municipal Recreation Program accounting procedures; fundamental principles and practices of supervision including, evaluating, directing, motivating, training, counseling, commending, and disciplining subordinate personnel; pertinent City and Personnel Department rules, policies, and procedures, including Equal Employment Opportunities and Sexual Harassment policies and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) as they relate to subordinate personnel; public relations techniques, including diplomacy, sufficient to resolve problems without jeopardizing the Department's reputation; and the ability to delegate work to subordinate personnel in an efficient manner in order to optimize available resources such as staff, volunteers, equipment, and funds; perform basic arithmetic calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentages; read and interpret written procedures; and other necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities.

Passing Score for Qualifying Written Test

The passing score for the qualifying written test will be determined by Personnel Department staff after the qualifying written test is administered.  Consideration will be given to the number of candidates taking the test and the existing and anticipated number of vacancies such that there are a sufficient number of eligibles on the list to satisfy current and future vacancies for the next two years.  Therefore, the passing score for the qualifying multiple-choice written test may be set either above or below 70%.

On the same day as the qualifying written test, candidates will be required to prepare some written material in response to a problem related to the duties and responsibilities of a Senior Recreation Director. This essay material will not be scored separately, but will be presented to the interview panel for discussion with the candidate and for consideration in the overall evaluation of the candidate's qualifications.  Candidates may anticipate that PCs (personal computers) will be made available to type their essay responses.

Those who do not complete the advisory essay will not be invited to the interview and will be considered to have failed the entire examination.  Candidates must achieve a passing score in the qualifying written test in order to be called for subsequent portions of the examination. Candidates who pass the qualifying written test and complete the advisory essay will be invited to participate in the interview. 

Candidates will be notified later by e-mail of the time and location of the qualifying written test and advisory essay, which will be administered in a single half-day session in Los Angeles, on SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 2017.

The examination score will be based entirely on the interview.  In the interview, candidates may be examined for knowledge of: Department of Recreation and Park Municipal Recreation Program accounting procedures sufficient to properly charge accounts; community cultural programs including dance, drama classes, arts and crafts tailored for the community centers and the diverse ethnic population they serve; safety principles, practices, and regulations as they relate to the inspection of recreational facilities for observable hazards, and providing a safe environment in all recreational facilities per Cal/OSHA safety regulations; problem solving techniques in order to make decisions with minimal or no supervision; fundamental principles and practices of supervision including, evaluating, directing, motivating, training, counseling, commending, and disciplining subordinate personnel; pertinent City and Personnel Department rules, policies, and procedures, including Equal Employment Opportunities and Sexual Harassment policies and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) as they relate to subordinate personnel; public relations techniques sufficient to effectively resolve problems; and the ability to plan special events such as banquets ending a sports league season and carnivals; analyze information, formulate recommendations, and make good independent decisions; be assertive when necessary by taking charge of situations in order to control the activities and conduct of the public at a municipal recreation facility; communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with the public, subordinates, and supervisors sufficient to relate or solicit information; interact effectively with members of the public, elected officials, and management in order to promote good public relations; and other necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities.
